  "This project is a modern text editor built from scratch with DraftJS. It supports most of the commands that other text editors implement such as inline styling, block alignment and media such as images and videos as well. The editor comes with some pre-built headers and paragraphs to maximize your performance while working. The files can be saved as .json and later can be opened in the editor or you can export them as PDF. Right now the Editor supports only specific .json files, but in the future more formats will be supported. Currently the 'Save As File' and 'Save As PDF' do not work because of the free plans of Heroku deployment, but in order to try just pull the GitHub repository from https://github.com/davidprifti/editor-api and run it localy.";
